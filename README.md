# Complete-Finance-Tracker-2020

Rails 6 Finance Tracker from the Complete Ruby on Rails Developer course
by Mashrur Hossain at
[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-ruby-on-rails-developer-course/)

## Deployed version

It can be seen running [here](https://jgn-ft-2020.herokuapp.com/).
It's a free Heroku instance, so it'll take up to 30 seconds to load the first time.

## Progress

  Lesson 246 - App complete

## Differences from Mashrur

* I commit my files much more often than Mashrur suggests. generally at the
  completion of each lesson, at least.

* I have styled the app a bit differently.

* I have deployed to Heroku more often too.

* Mashrur performs three separate SQL queries for users and then deduplicates the
  results. It is much better to perform one query, which will return a set of results
  with no duplicates.
