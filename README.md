## Deployed version

It can be seen running [here](https://jgn-ft-2020.herokuapp.com/).
It's a free Heroku instance, so it'll take up to 30 seconds to load the first time.

## Progress

## Differences from Mashrur

* I commit my files much more often than Mashrur suggests. generally at the
  completion of each lesson, at least.

* I have styled the app a bit differently.

* I have deployed to Heroku more often too.
